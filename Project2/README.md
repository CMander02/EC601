##### Ziyan Chen, zychen02@bu.edu

The python program is twitterapi.py, and it will generate a word cloud wordcould.png for the analysis.



The program supports:

- Finding the basic data of a twitter user by his/hers username
- Generate recent twitters on a specific hashtag
- Draw word cloud for twitters above

Follow instructions in the program to get results.
